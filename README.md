# LibreSense
App for sensory analysis

This is  a first attempt  at building  an open source software for sensory analysis.
In this first step we are trying to build an app for QDA (Qunatitative descriptive analysis)

app-LibreSense actually contains two apps:
the file app.r is  the app for capturing data from  panelists. The idea is that the leader of the sensory panel can modify the name and  number of the samples and also the descriptors.
The  second app (server.R and ui.R) is for visualizing the results
In case that you want to colaborate please the issues
